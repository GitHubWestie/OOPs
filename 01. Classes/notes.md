## Object Oriented Principals

### What is an object?
Objects begin with a class. You can think of a class as a blueprint. The object is an instance of that blueprint.

If you think about a class or blueprint in the context of a human it might say  a human has a head, left arm, right arm, torso, left leg and right leg. 

What it wouldnt say is if that human likes to play guitar, ride a bike or play video games. Those kinds of attributes would be unique to the implementation of the object or instance of the class.

### Creating a Class
By convention classes always begin with a capital letter.

```php
class Person
{

}
```

Classes may also contain functions. When a function is defined within a class it is known as a Method. Just is.
